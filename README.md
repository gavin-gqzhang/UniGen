## âœ… TODO
- [x] **2025.08.20**: ***[UniGen](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17364) paper uploaded to arXiv.***

- [ ] **2025.09.01**: ***upload UniGen inference code.*** 

- [x] **2025.09.05**: ***Upload checkpoints to [Hugging face](https://huggingface.co/gavin-zhang/UniGen).*** 

- [ ] ***Upload UniGen training code.*** 

## Instruction
### Environment Preparation
Setup the env first (need to wait a few minutes).
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate unigen
```

### Checkpoint Preparation

```
Upload completed quickly
```

### Data Preparation 
- MultiGen-20M
    - Please download the training dataset ([MultiGen-20M](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/sfr-unicontrol-data-research/dataset)) to `./multigen20m`.
        ```
        cd multigen20m
        gsutil -m cp -r gs://sfr-unicontrol-data-research/dataset ./
        ```
    - Then unzip the all the files.
    - Download the training and test data split from the MultiGen-20M dataset: [Json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gavin-zhang/MultiGen20M_json). All images were relabeled using [Qwen](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat).
    
- Subjects 200K
    - Download the preprocessed Subjects-200K dataset from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gavin-zhang/Subjects200K).
    - Then unzip the all the files.

### Training model
